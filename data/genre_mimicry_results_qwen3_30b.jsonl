Instead of hacking into systems directly, attackers manipulate individuals into divulging sensitive information, granting access, or performing actions that compromise security.\n\n### Key Mechanics of Social Engineering Attacks\n\n1. **Target Selection**: \n   - Attackers identify specific individuals or groups (e.g., employees in a company, customers, executives).\n   - Targets are chosen based on their level of access or influence.\n\n2. **Information Gathering**:\n   - Using open-source intelligence (OSINT), social media, or phishing emails to collect details about the target (e.g., job title, interests, contacts).\n\n3. **Building Trust/Creating Urgency**:\n   - Attackers impersonate trusted figures (e.g., IT support, executives, banks).\n   - They create a sense of urgency (\"Your account will be locked in 10 minutes!\") or fear (\"You\u2019ve been implicated in a fraud case\") to prompt quick action.\n\n4. **Manipulation and Deception**:\n   - Use psychological tactics like authority (feigning power), scarcity, social proof, or reciprocity.\n   - Examples include fake emails, phone calls, text messages, or even in-person deception.\n\n5. **Exploitation**:\n   - Once the victim complies\u2014by clicking a link, downloading malware, sharing passwords, or transferring money\u2014the attacker gains access to systems or data.\n\n---\n\n### Common Types and Real-World Examples\n\n1. **Phishing**\n   - **Mechanics**: Sending fraudulent emails that appear to come from legitimate sources (e.g., banks, Microsoft) asking users to click a link or download an attachment.\n   - **Example**: An email claiming your \u201cNetflix account has been suspended\u201d with a malicious link leading to a fake login page.\n\n2. **Spear Phishing**\n   - **Mechanics**: Highly targeted phishing aimed at specific individuals using personalized information.\n   - **Example**: A hacker emails an executive, pretending to be the CEO, asking for urgent wire transfers.\n\n3. **Smishing (SMS Phishing)**\n   - **Mechanics**: Using text messages to trick victims into revealing personal data or clicking links.\n   - **Example**: \u201cYou\u2019ve won a prize!
